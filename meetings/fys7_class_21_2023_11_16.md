# Philosophical Objections

## Argument from Consciousness (Jefferson)
* AI can't have emotion, pleasure, griefs, etc.
* Because of thoughts and emotions felt

### The position
* If you take this position, you can't prove anyone else thinks. We never know this.

### Turing's response

## Arguments from various disabilities (Nuclear Onion)

### The position
* A machine can't do X.
* Have emotion

### Turing's response
* No proof offered.
* People are thinking of machines they've seen.

## Lady Lovelace's Objection (Spiderwork)

### The position
* Computer's lack the ability to do anything new
* Not creative

### Turing's response
* Machine can never do anything really new?
* There is nothing new under the sun.
* How do you know where 
* What is this point (when is this claim made).
* This is again turning the argument around.
* Harold Bloom's "Anxiety of Influence"
