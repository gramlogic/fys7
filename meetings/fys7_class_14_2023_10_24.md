# Singularity:
## How do they imagine the future?
* Something in it for them...
  * Incentive to say something dramatic about the future.
* Either incredibly prosperous or desolate. 
* Possibility
   * The end of the world
   * Godlike slaves

## How do they think of themselves in relation to the world?
* They are the heralds or prophets of the end.
* Maybe not necessarily as self-aggrandizing as that..
* Humans are supreme.
* Through some kind of intelligence / technology and evolution.

## For whom do they speak
* All of humanity.

# Cyborg
## How do they imagine the future?
* Societal lense / collective.
* Call for change: inevitable / also necessary.
* Walking forward into a new world.
* More positive, more about the influence of technology as a whole.
* Somewhere between utopian and dystopian (note: unpack this later)

## How do they think of themselves in relation to the world?
* More informative than a warning.
* Position like a philosopher; vastly different world view.
* Less rational (unpack).
* The idea is that rationality is built on axioms; questioning those axioms.

## For whom do they speak
* Humanity. Maybe the same group.
* More for "protected classes" or underrepresented groups.
* Social groups that they represent.
* More as coalition.
