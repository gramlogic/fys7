# Irony and Blasphemy

## Blasphemy
* Just because your blasphemous doesn't mean you aren't faithful. You still have to understand what you don't believe.
* Taking things seriously.
* Blasphemy protects from the moral majority within:
  * within the community
  * within the self?
* Parallel to Martin Luther?
* Apostasy: I'm not leaving



## Irony
* Contradictions that do not resolve into larger wholes
* tension of holding incompatible things together because they are necessary and true
* What is dialectically?
  * Logic conclusion using multiple perspectives.
  * Thesis.
  * Antithesis.
  * Synthesis.
* Humor and serious play. Mixing.
* Rhetorical strategy and political method.
